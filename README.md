# IPL-Data-Analysis---SQL
I have analyzed the dataset of IPL Cricket Matches and Ball-by-ball data using SQL.

The first CSV file is for ball-by-ball data and it has information of all the 193468 balls bowled between the years 2008 and 2020.

The second file contains match-wise data and has data of 816 IPL matches. 


1. Create a table named ‘matches’ with appropriate data types for columns

2. Create a table named ‘deliveries’ with appropriate data types for columns

3. Import data from CSV file ’IPL_matches.csv’ attached in resources to ‘matches’

4. Import data from CSV file ’IPL_Ball.csv’ attached in resources to ‘deliveries’

5. Select the top 20 rows of the deliveries table.

6. Select the top 20 rows of the matches table.

7. Fetch data of all the matches played on 2nd May 2013.

8. Fetch data of all the matches where the margin of victory is more than 100 runs.

9. Fetch data of all the matches where the final scores of both teams tied and order it in

descending order of the date.

10. Get the count of cities that have hosted an IPL match.
